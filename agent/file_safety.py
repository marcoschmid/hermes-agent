        carrier.
      * Credential / secret stores under HERMES_HOME and the global Hermes
        root: ``auth.json``, ``auth.lock``, ``.anthropic_oauth.json``,
        ``.env``, ``webhook_subscriptions.json``, ``auth/google_oauth.json``,
        and anything under ``mcp-tokens/``. These hold plaintext provider keys,
        OAuth tokens, and HMAC secrets that the agent never needs to read
        directly — provider tools / gateway adapters consume them through
        internal channels.
      * Project-local environment files anywhere on disk: ``.env``,
        ``.env.local``, ``.env.development``, ``.env.production``,
        ``.env.test``, ``.env.staging``, ``.envrc``. These routinely hold
        API keys, database passwords, and other credentials for the user's
        own projects. The agent helping debug a project shouldn't normally
        need to read these — ``.env.example`` is the documented-shape
        substitute.

    **This is NOT a security boundary.** The terminal tool runs as the
    same OS user with shell access; the agent can still ``cat auth.json``
    or ``cat ~/.hermes/.env`` and exfiltrate the file. The read-deny exists
    as defense-in-depth that:

      * Returns a clear error to models that respect tool denials, which
        empirically prompts most modern models to stop rather than reach
        for the shell.
      * Surfaces a visible audit trail when something tries to read
        credentials — easier to spot in logs than a generic ``cat``.

    Treat any user-visible framing around this as "may help" rather than
    "stops attackers." A determined model or malicious instruction can
    always shell out.

    Callers that resolve relative paths against a non-process cwd
    (e.g. ``TERMINAL_CWD`` in ``tools/file_tools.py``) MUST pre-resolve
    and pass the absolute path string.  This function's own ``resolve()``
    is anchored at the Python process cwd, so a relative input like
    ``"auth.json"`` would otherwise miss the denylist when the task's
    terminal cwd differs from the process cwd.
